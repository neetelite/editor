If you remove character from and already split character you should be able to input back that many characters
Update buffer_read_path so it only allocates one buffers and sets the pointers correctly
For now you're force to have at least one line per buffer, may change later?
Only update or draw content when needed
Any more that is not up or down should reset x_min
Make it so creating a new buffer doesn't also create a new line
